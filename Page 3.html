		<h2>Pros</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reason 1</strong>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Going out to see a film on the big screen can help give the audience a better reception to the film, if you’re going to see an action film, the bigger screen and louder stereo may give a scene a bigger impact watching it at the theatres rather than your home. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;<strong>Reason 2</strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> The movie theatre may attract a bigger and older audience, this may be because of some older people may not be as tech savvy as younger people and feel as if they can’t access the film because it is online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Reason 3</strong>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> Movie studios are going to make more at the theatre than online, giving them more chance to profit off the film and continue with future projects. This will likely sway them to make delays than taking any risks.</p>

		<h2>Cons</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Reason 1</strong>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The decision movie studios have to make to delay their film may have an impact on the hype a film may have. Some people may have forgotten about the film or get less excited for a film the longer they have to wait. This may lead to smaller numbers than releasing the film earlier. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>Reason 2&nbsp;</strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> If the situations around the world doesn’t get any better films may have to get pushed back even further. When restrictions are lifted the theatre may still be limited to the amount of people that can be seated in a theatre causing smaller numbers for both the movie theatre and the film</p>
