		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>With the current events in the world today many industries have been affected and is forced to make changes in order to survive. One of the biggest industries harmed by this is entertainment, but today I will be focusing on film. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> The movie business relies on releasing their new films in theatres to make box office and do numbers, but with current lockdown restrictions they have to adapt and find new ways to release their films.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> Many of films have been delayed to a later date, such as Wonder Woman 1984, The new Batman movie, the live action Mulan film and more, this is a way to get the movies shown in theatres. But other films are choosing to go to online services. Films such as Greyhound, Antlers and The King of Staten Island have decided to stream their movies for the first time digitally. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> The effect this has on the film industry may be significant as it may change the decisions made from the production companies on whether or not they release their film early online or wait until restrictions ease up to go to the theatres. </p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> I will now be discussing about both the positives and negatives for both online streaming and movie theatres. </p>
